# RotinaNet-6D
This project aims to develope a detector cabable of detecting and predicting the 6D pose of objects in RGB images. The structur of the detector will be based on the RetinaNet detector proposed in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf). As a starting point the [Keras RetinaNet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) implementation provided by Fizyr will be used. 

## Benchmarking 
The detector will be benchmarked on the [LINEMOD](https://bop.felk.cvut.cz/datasets/) dataset.
